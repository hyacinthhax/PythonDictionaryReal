# PythonDictionaryReal
This is a simple python dictionary project to turn a dictionary into a python dictionary. This is for offline use, and can be made to a word a day program. I need to change some of the definitions, some of them are rather dated or rely on notes for the word. For instance definition linking like 'scientist' is smaller than 'scientific'. I also added a new program to look up words individually.
You will need this file to use as it's too large to upload, just a real python dictionary

The Original Gutenburg Project's Unabridged Dictionary can be found here for full download; From the Summary Section:  http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/673

The Easier TXT file was found here:  https://github.com/sujithps/Dictionary
The ORIGINAL TXT file was found here:  https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/673

***NOTE: I recently found the Original Dictionary so a new code is needed to make the dictionary sort properly since it has a ton of HTML; However the links to each word are there so it will make it easier***

This should be ready to run, I have the modified dictionary file at this location: https://www.mediafire.com/file/hnhp6mwr1sakdri/DictionaryReal.py/file
This download is just if you don't want to use my results, use DictionarySorter.py otherwise results are in results.py as a Dictionary
