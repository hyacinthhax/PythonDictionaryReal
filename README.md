# PythonDictionaryReal
This is a simple python dictionary project to turn a dictionary into a python dictionary. This is for offline use, and can be made to a word a day program. I need to change some of the definitions, some of them are rather dated or rely on notes for the word. For instance "Scientist"
You will need this file to use as it's too large to upload, just a real python dictionary

The Original TXT file was found here https://github.com/sujithps/Dictionary

This should be ready to run, I have the modified dictionary file at this location: https://www.mediafire.com/file/hnhp6mwr1sakdri/DictionaryReal.py/file
This download is just if you don't want to use my results, use DictionarySorter.py otherwise results are in results.py as a Dictionary
