# PythonDictionaryReal
This is a simple python dictionary project to turn a dictionary into a python dictionary. This is for offline use, and can be made to a word a day program.
You will need this file to use as it's too large to upload, until I work out the kinks to get just a real pyhton dictionary file: https://www.mediafire.com/file/wl7bcsw344gxzsc/dictionary.zip/file
This should be ready to run, I have the dictionary file at this locaation: https://www.mediafire.com/file/hnhp6mwr1sakdri/DictionaryReal.py/file
