<p>
      X (ks). X, the twenty-fourth letter of the English alphabet, has three
      sounds; a compound nonvocal sound (that of <i>ks</i>), as in <i>wax</i>; a
      compound vocal sound (that of <i>gz</i>), as in <i>example</i>; and, at
      the beginning of a word, a simple vocal sound (that of <i>z</i>), as in <i>xanthic</i>.
      See <i>Guide to Pronunciation</i>, §§ 217, 270, 271.
    </p>
<p>
      The form and value of X are from the Latin X, which is from the Greek ,

      a fricative vocal consonant; as a prefix, and usually in the middle or at
      the end of a syllable, it is a vowel. See <i>Guide to Pronunciation</i>,
      §§ 145, 178-9, 272.
    </p>
<p>
      It derives its form from the Latin Y, which is from the Greek , originally
      the same letter as V. Etymologically, it is most nearly related to <i>u</i>,

      AS. <i>fyllan</i>; E. <i>crypt</i>, <i>grotto</i>; <i>young</i>, <i>juvenile</i>;
      <i>day</i>, AS. <i>dæg</i>. See U, I, and J, G.
    </p>
<p>
      Y has been called the <i>Pythagorean letter</i>, because the Greek letter
      was taken represent the sacred triad, formed by the duad proceeding from
      the monad; and also because it represents the dividing of the paths of
      vice and virtue in the development of human life.

      would have been replied, ‘Yea' or ‘Nay', as the case might be.
      But, ‘Will he not come?' To this the answer would have been ‘Yes'
      or ‘No.' Sir Thomas More finds fault with Tyndale, that in his

      Army organization. The system by which a country raises, classifies,
      arranges, and equips its armed land forces. The usual divisions are: (<i>1</i>)
      A <i>regular</i> or <i>active army</i>, in which soldiers serve
      continuously with the colors and live in barracks or cantonments when not
      in the field; (<i>2</i>) the <i>reserves</i> of this army, in which the
      soldiers, while remaining constantly subject to a call to the colors, live
      at their homes, being summoned more or less frequently to report for
      instruction, drill, or maneuvers; and (<i>3</i>) one or more classes of
      soldiers organized largely for territorial defense, living at home and
      having only occasional periods of drill and instraction, who are variously
      called <i>home reserves</i> (as in the table below), <i>second</i>, <i>third</i>,
      etc., <i>line of defense</i> (the regular army and its reserves ordinarily
      constituting the <i>first line of defense</i>), <i>territorial forces</i>,
      or the like. In countries where conscription prevails a soldier is
      supposed to serve a given number of years. He is usually enrolled first in
      the regular army, then passes to its reserve, then into the home reserves,
      to serve until he reaches the age limit. It for any reason he is not
      enrolled in the regular army, he may begin his service in the army
      reserves or even the home reserves, but then serves the full number of
      years or up to the age limit. In equipment the organization of the army is
      into the three great arms of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, together
      with more or less numerous other branches, such as engineers, medical
      corps, etc., besides the staff organizations such as those of the pay and
      subsistence departments.

      Bau`mé" (?), <i>a.</i> Designating or conforming to either of the
      scales used by the French chemist Antoine Baumé in the graduation
      of his hydrometers; of or relating to Baumé's scales or
      hydrometers. There are two Baumé hydrometers. One, which is used
      with liquids heavier than water, sinks to 0° in pure water, and to 15°
      in a 15 per cent salt solution; the other, for liquids lighter than water,
      sinks to 0° in a 10 per cent salt solution and to 10° in pure
      water. In both cases the graduation, based on the distance between these
      fundamental points, is continued along the stem as far as desired. Since
      all the degrees on a Baumé scale are thus equal in length, while
      those on a specific-gravity scale grow smaller as the density increases,
      there is no simple relation between degrees Bé. and Sp. gr.
      However, readings on Baumés scale may be approximately reduced to
      specific gravities by the following formulæ (<i>x</i> in each case
      being the reading on Baumé's scale) : <i>(a)</i> for liquids
      heavier than water, sp. gr. = 144 ÷ (144 - <i>x</i>); <i>(b)</i>
      for liquids lighter than water, sp. gr. = 144 ÷ (134 + <i>x</i>).

      Date line. The hypothetical line on the surface of the earth fixed by
      international or general agreement as a boundary on one side of which the
      same day shall have a different name and date in the calendar from its
      name and date on the other side.
    </p>
<p>
      Speaking generally, the date line coincides with the meridian 180°
      from Greenwich. It deflects between north latitudes 80° and 45°,
      so that all Asia lies to the west, all North America, including the
      Aleutian Islands, to the east of the line; and between south latitudes 12°
      and 56°, so that Chatham Island and the Tonga group lie to the west of
      it. A vessel crossing this line to the westward sets the date forward by
      one day, as from Sunday to Monday. A vessel crossing the line to the
      eastward sets the date back by one day, as from Monday to Sunday. Hawaii
      has the same day name as San Francisco; Manila, the same day name as
      Australia, and this is one day later than the day of Hawaii. Thus when it
      is Monday May 1st at San Francisco it is Tuesday may 2d at Manila.

      Eastern Church. That portion of the Christian church which prevails in the
      countries once comprised in the Eastern Roman Empire and the countries
      converted to Christianity by missionaries from them. Its full official
      title is <i>The Orthodox Catholic Apostolic Eastern Church</i>. It became
      estranged from the Western, or Roman, Church over the question of papal
      supremacy and the doctrine of the filioque, and a separation, begun in the
      latter part of the 9th century, became final in 1054. The Eastern Church
      consists of twelve (thirteen if the Bulgarian Church be included) mutually
      independent churches (including among these the Hellenic Church, or Church
      of Greece, and the Russian Church), using the vernacular (or some ancient
      form of it) in divine service and varying in many points of detail, but
      standing in full communion with each other and united as equals in a great
      federation. The highest five authorities are the patriarch of
      Constantinople, or ecumenical patriarch (whose position is not one of
      supremacy, but of precedence), the patriarch of Alexandria, the patriarch
      of Jerusalem, the patriarch of Antioch, and the Holy Synod of Russia. The
      Eastern Church accepts the first seven ecumenical councils (and is hence
      styled only schismatic, not heretical, by the Roman Catholic Church), has
      as its creed the Niceno-Constantinopolitan (without the later addition of
      the filioque, which, with the doctrine it represents, the church
      decisively rejects), baptizes infants with trine immersion, makes
      confirmation follow immediately upon baptism, administers the Communion in
      both kinds (using leavened bread) and to infants as well as adults,
      permits its secular clergy to marry before ordination and to keep their
      wives afterward, but not to marry a second time, selects its bishops from
      the monastic clergy only, recognizes the offices of bishop, priest, and
      deacon as the three necessary degrees of orders, venerates relics and
      icons, and has an elaborate ritual.

    </p>
<p>
      The surface along which the dislocated masses have moved is called the <b>fault
      plane</b>. When this plane is vertical, the fault is a <b>vertical fault</b>;
      when its inclination is such that the present relative position of the two
      masses could have been produced by the sliding down, along the fault
      plane, of the mass on its upper side, the fault is a <b>normal</b>, or <b>gravity</b>,
      <b>fault</b>. When the fault plane is so inclined that the mass on its
      upper side has moved up relatively, the fault is then called a <b>reverse</b>
      (or <b>reversed</b>), <b>thrust</b>, or <b>overthrust</b>, <b>fault</b>.
      If no vertical displacement has resulted, the fault is then called a <b>horizontal
      fault</b>. The linear extent of the dislocation measured on the fault
      plane and in the direction of movement is the <b>displacement</b>; the
      vertical displacement is the <b>throw</b>; the horizontal displacement is
      the <b>heave</b>. The direction of the line of intersection of the fault
      plane with a horizontal plane is the <b>trend</b> of the fault. A fault is
      a <b>strike fault</b> when its trend coincides approximately with the
      strike of associated strata (i.e., the line of intersection of the plane
      of the strata with a horizontal plane); it is a <b>dip fault</b> when its
      trend is at right angles to the strike; an <b>oblique fault</b> when its
      trend is oblique to the strike. Oblique faults and dip faults are
      sometimes called <b>cross faults</b>. A series of closely associated
      parallel faults are sometimes called <b>step faults</b> and sometimes <b>distributive
      faults</b>.

      I"do ("d), <i>n.</i> An artificial international language, selected by the
      "Delegation for the Adoption of an Auxillary International Language"
      (founded at Paris in 1901), made public in 1907, and subsequently greatly
      revised and extended by a permanent committee or "Academy." It combines
      systematically the advantages of previous schemes with a thoroughly
      logical word formation, and has neither accented constants nor arbitrarily
      coined pronominal words. For each idea that root is selected which is
      already most international, on the principle of the "greatest facility for
      the greatest number of people." The word "Ido" means in the language
      itself "offspring." The official name is: "Linguo Internaciona di la

      the heat or pressure energy necessary to produce motion is developed in
      the engine cylinder, as by the explosion of a gas, and not in a separate
      chamber, as in a steam-engine boiler. The gas used may be a fixed gas, or
      one derived from alcohol, ether, gasoline (petrol), naphtha, oil
      (petroleum), etc. There are three main classes: (1) <b>gas engines</b>
      proper, using fixed gases, as coal, blast-furnace, or producer gas; (2)
      engines using the vapor of a volatile fluid, as the typical <b>gasoline
      (petrol) engine</b>; (3) <b>oil engines</b>, using either an atomized
      spray or the vapor (produced by heat) of a comparatively heavy oil, as
      petroleum or kerosene. In all of these the gas is mixed with a definite
      amount of air, the charge is composed in the cylinder and is then exploded
      either by a flame of gas (<b>flame ignition</b> -- now little used), by a
      hot tube (<b>tube ignition</b>) or the like, by an electric spark (<b>electric
      ignition</b>, the usual method is gasoline engines, or by the heat of
      compression, as in the Diesel engine. Gas and oil engines are chiefly of
      the stationary type. Gasoline engines are largely used for automobile
      vehicles, boats, etc. Most internal- combustion engines use the Otto
      (four-stroke) cycle, though many use the two-stroke cycle. They are almost
      universally trunk engines and single-acting. Because of the intense heat
      produced by the frequent explosions, the cylinders must be cooled by a
      water jacket (<b>water-cooled</b>) or by air currents (<b>air cooled</b>)
      to give the maximum thermodynamic efficiency and to avoid excessive
      friction or seizing.

      I"on, <i>n.</i> <b>1.</b> One of the electrified particles into which,
      according to the electrolytic dissociation theory, the molecules of
      electrolytes are divided by water and other solvents. An <i>ion</i>
      consists of one or more atoms and carries a unit charge of electricity,
      3.4 x 10<sup>-10</sup> electrostatic units, or a multiple of this. Those
      which are positively electrified (hydrogen and the metals) are called <i>cations</i>;
      negative ions (hydroxyl and acidic atoms or groups) are called <i>anions</i>.
      Thus, hydrochloric acid (HCl) dissociates, in aqueous solution, into the
      hydrogen ion, H+, and the chlorine ion, Cl-; ferric nitrate, Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>,
      yields the ferric ion, Fe+++, and nitrate ions, NO3-, NO3- , NO3-. When a
      solution containing ions is made part of an electric circuit, the cations
      move toward the cathode, the anions toward the anode. This movement is
      called <b>migration</b>, and the velocity of it differs for different
      kinds of ions. If the electromotive force is sufficient, electrolysis
      ensues: cations give up their charge at the cathode and separate in
      metallic form or decompose water, forming hydrogen and alkali; similarly,
      at the anode the element of the anion separates, or the metal of the anode
      is dissolved, or decomposition occurs.
    </p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> One of the small electrified particles into which the molecules
      of a gas are broken up under the action of the electric current, of
      ultraviolet and certain other rays, and of high temperatures. To the
      properties and behavior of ions the phenomena of the electric discharge
      through rarefied gases and many other important effects are ascribed. At
      low pressures the negative ions appear to be electrons; the positive ions,
      atoms minus an electron. At ordinary pressures each ion seems to include
      also a number of attached molecules. Ions may be formed in a gas in
      various ways.

      Jew"ish cal"en*dar. A lunisolar calendar in use among Hebraic peoples,
      reckoning from the year 3761 b. c., the date traditionally given for the
      Creation. It received its present fixed form from Hillel II. about 360 a.
      d. The present names of the months, which are Babylonian-Assyrian in
      origin, replaced older ones, <i>Abib</i>, <i>Bul</i>, etc., at the time of
      the Babylonian Exile. Nineteen years constitute a lunar cycle, of which
      the 3d, 6th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 19th years are leap years. The
      year 5663 [1902-3 a. d.] was the first year of the 299th lunar cycle. The
      common year is said to be <i>defective</i>, <i>regular</i>, or <i>perfect</i>
      (or <i>abundant</i>) according as it has 353, 354, or 355 days. The leap
      year has an intercalary month, and a total of 383 (defective), 384
      (regular), or 385 (perfect, or abundant) days. The calendar is complicated
      by various rules providing for the harmonious arrangement of festivals,
      etc., so that no simple perpetual calendar can be constructed. The
      following table gives the months in order, with the number of days
      assigned to each. Only three months vary in length. They are: Heshvan,
      which has 30 days in perfect years; Kislev, which has 30 days in regular
      and perfect years; and Adar, which has 30 days in leap years. The
      ecclesiastical year commences with Nisan and the civil year with Tishri.
      The date of the first of Tishri, or the Jewish New Year, is also given for
      the Jewish years 5661-5696 (1900- 1935 a. d.). From these tables it is
      possible to transform any Jewish date into Christian, or vice versa, for
      the years 1900-1935 a. d.

      Malaria parasite. Any of several minute protozoans of the genus <i>Plasmodium</i>
      (syn. <i>Hæmatozoön</i>) which in their adult condition live in
      the tissues of mosquitoes of the genus <i>Anopheles</i> (which see) and
      when transferred to the blood of man, by the bite of the mosquito, produce
      malaria. The young parasites, or <b>sporozoites</b>, enter the red blood
      corpuscles, growing at their expense, undergoing sporulation, and finally
      destroying the corpuscles, thus liberating in the blood plasma an immense
      number of small spores called <b>merozoites</b>. An indefinite but not
      ultimated number of such generations may follow, but if meanwhile the host
      is bitten by a mosquito, the parasites develop into gametes in the stomach
      of the insect. These conjugate, the zygote thus produced divides, forming
      spores, and eventually sporozoites, which, penetrating to the salivary
      glands of the mosquito, may be introduced into a new host. The attacks of
      the disease coincide with the dissolution of the corpuscles and liberation
      of the spores and products of growth of the parasites into the blood
      plasma. Several species of the parasite are distinguished, as <i>P. vivax</i>,
      producing tertian malaria; <i>P. malariæ</i>, quartan malaria; and
      <i>P. (subgenus Laverania) falciferum</i>, the malarial fever of summer
      and autumn common in the tropics.

<p>
      Men"del's law (?). A principle governing the inheritance of many
      characters in animals and plants, discovered by Gregor J. Mendel (Austrian
      Augustinian abbot, 1822-84) in breeding experiments with peas. He showed
      that the height, color, and other characters depend on the presence of
      determinating factors behaving as units. In any given germ cell each of
      these is either present or absent. The following example (using letters as
      symbols of the determining factors and hence also of the individuals
      possessing them) shows the operation of the law: Tallness being due to a
      factor <i>T</i>, a tall plant, arising by the union in fertilization of
      two germ cells both bearing this factor, is <i>TT</i>; a dwarf, being
      without <i>T</i>, is <i>tt</i>. Crossing these, crossbreeds, <i>Tt</i>,
      result (called generation <i>F</i>1). In the formation of the germ cells
      of these crossbreeds a process of segregation occurs such that germ cells,
      whether male or female, are produced of two kinds, <i>T</i> and <i>t</i>,
      in equal numbers. The <i>T</i> cells bear the factor "tallness," the <i>t</i>
      cells are devoid of it. The offspring, generation <i>F</i>2, which arise
      from the chance union of these germ cells in pairs, according to the law
      of probability, are therefore on an average in the following proportions:
    </p>
<p>
      1 <i>TT</i> : 2 <i>Tt</i> : 1 <i>tt</i>;
    </p>
<p>
      and thus plants pure in tallness (<i>TT</i>) and dwarfness (<i>tt</i>), as
      well as crossbreeds (<i>Tt</i>), are formed by the interbreeding of
      crossbreeds. Frequently, as in this example, owning to what is called the
      <i>dominance</i> of a factor, the operation of Mendel's law may be
      complicated by the fact that when a <i>dominant</i> factor (as <i>T</i>)
      occurs with its allelomorph (as <i>t</i>), called <i>recessive</i>, in the
      crossbreed <i>Tt</i>, the individual <i>Tt</i> is itself indistinguishable
      from the pure form <i>TT</i>. Generation <i>F</i>1, containing only the <i>Tt</i>
      form, consists entirely of dominants (tall plants) and generation <i>F</i>2
      consists of three dominants (2 <i>Tt</i>, 1 <i>TT</i>) to one dwarf (<i>tt</i>),
      which, displaying the feature suppressed in <i>F</i>1, is called <i>recessive</i>.
      Such qualitative and numerical regularity has been proved to exist in
      regard to very diverse qualities or characters which compose living
      things, both wild and domesticated, such as colors of flowers, of hair or
      eyes, patterns, structure, chemical composition, and power of resisting
      certain diseases. The diversity of forms produced in crossbreeding by
      horticulturists and fanciers generally results from a process of
      analytical variation or recombination of the factors composing the
      parental types. Purity of type consequently acquires a specific meaning.
      An individual is pure in respect of a given character when it results from
      the union of two sexual cells both bearing that character, or both without
      it.

      Mohammedan year has a maximum error of a day: Multiply 970,224 by the
      Mohammedan year, point off six decimal places, and add 621.5774. The whole
      number will be the year a. d., and the decimal multiplied by 365 will give
      the day of the year.

      phases, plus two</i>. Thus, if the components be salt and water, and the
      phases salt, ice, saturated solution, and vapor, the system is invariant,
      that is, there is only one set of conditions under which these four phases
      can exist in equilibrium. If only three phases be considered, the system

      plants exposed to the action of light. It was formerly called <i>assimilation</i>,
      but this is now commonly used as in animal physiology. The details of the
      process are not yet clearly known. Baeyer's theory is that the carbon
      dioxide is reduced to carbon monoxide, which, uniting with the hydrogen of
      the water in the cell, produces formaldehyde, the latter forming various
      sugars through polymerization. Vines suggests that the carbohydrates are
      secretion products of the chloroplasts, derived from decomposition of
      previously formed proteids. The food substances are usually quickly
      translocated, those that accumulate being changed to starch, which appears
      in the cells almost simultaneously with the sugars. The chloroplasts
      perform photosynthesis only in light and within a certain range of
      temperature, varying according to climate. This is the only way in which a
      plant is able to organize carbohydrates. All plants without a chlorophyll
      apparatus, as the fungi, must be parasitic or saprophytic. --

<p>
      Police power. <i>(Law)</i> The inherent power of a government to regulate
      its police affairs. The term <i>police power</i> is not definitely fixed
      in meaning. In the earlier cases in the United States it was used as
      including the whole power of internal government, or the powers of
      government inherent in every sovereignty to the extent of its dominions
      (11 Peters (<i>U. S.</i>) 102). The later cases have excepted from its
      domain the development and administration of private law. Modern political
      science defines the power as a branch of internal administration in the
      exercise of which the executive should move within the lines of general
      principles prescribed by the constitution or the legislature, and in the
      exercise of which the most local governmental organizations should
      participate as far as possible (<i>Burgess</i>). Under this limitation the
      police power, as affecting persons, is the power of the state to protect
      the public against the abuse of individual liberty, that is, to restrain
      the individual in the exercise of his rights when such exercise becomes a
      danger to the community. The tendency of judicial and popular usage is
      towards this narrower definition.

      Post`-im*pres"sion*ism, <i>n.</i> <i>(Painting)</i> In the broadest sense,
      the theory or practice of any of several groups of recent painters, or of
      these groups taken collectively, whose work and theories have in common a
      tendency to reaction against the scientific and naturalistic character of
      impressionism and neo-impressionism. In a strict sense the term post-
      impressionism is used to denote the effort at self-expression, rather than
      representation, shown in the work of Cézanne, Matisse, etc.; but it
      is more broadly used to include <b>cubism</b>, the theory or practice of a
      movement in both painting and sculpture which lays stress upon volume as
      the important attribute of objects and attempts its expression by the use
      of geometrical figures or solids only; and <b>futurism</b>, a theory or
      practice which attempts to place the observer within the picture and to
      represent simultaneously a number of consecutive movements and
      impressions. In practice these theories and methods of the
      post-impressionists change with great rapidity and shade into one another,
      so that a picture may be both cubist and futurist in character. They tend
      to, and sometimes reach, a condition in which both representation and
      traditional decoration are entirely abolished and a work of art becomes a
      purely subjective expression in an arbitrary and personal language.

      intensely radioactive metallic element found (combined) in minute
      quantities in pitchblende, and various other uranium minerals. Symbol, <i>Ra</i>;
      atomic weight, 226.4. Radium was discovered by M. and Mme. Curie, of
      Paris, who in 1902 separated compounds of it by a tedious process from
      pitchblende. Its compounds color flames carmine and give a characteristic
      spectrum. It resembles barium chemically. Radium preparations are
      remarkable for maintaining themselves at a higher temperature than their
      surroundings, and for their radiations, which are of three kinds: <i>alpha
      rays</i>, <i>beta rays</i>, and <i>gamma rays</i> (see these terms). By
      reason of these rays they ionize gases, affect photographic plates, cause
      sores on the skin, and produce many other striking effects. Their degree
      of activity depends on the proportion of radium present, but not on its
      state of chemical combination or on external conditions.The radioactivity
      of radium is therefore an atomic property, and is explained as result from
      a disintegration of the atom. This breaking up occurs in at least seven
      stages; the successive main products have been studied and are called <b>radium
      emanation</b> or <i>exradio</i>, <b>radium A</b>, <b>radium B</b>, <b>radium
      C</b>, etc. (The emanation is a heavy gas, the later products are solids.)
      These products are regarded as unstable elements, each with an atomic
      weight a little lower than its predecessor. It is possible that lead is
      the stable end product. At the same time the light gas helium is formed;
      it probably consists of the expelled alpha particles. The heat effect
      mentioned above is ascribed to the impacts of these particles. Radium, in
      turn, is believed to be formed indirectly by an immeasurably slow
      disintegration of uranium.

      Re*serve", <i>n.</i> <b>1.</b> <i>(Finance)</i> <i>(a)</i> That part of

      in a more or less liquid form as a reasonable provision for meeting all
      demands which may be made upon it; specif.: <i>(b)</i> <i>(Banking)</i>
      Usually, the uninvested cash kept on hand for this purpose, called the <i>real
      reserve</i>. In Great Britain the ultimate <i>real reserve</i> is the gold
      kept on hand in the Bank of England, largely represented by the notes in
      hand in its own banking department; and any balance which a bank has with
      the Bank of England is a part of its <i>reserve</i>. In the United States
      the reserve of a national bank consists of the amount of lawful money it
      holds on hand against deposits, which is required by law to be not less
      than 15 per cent (<i>U. S. Rev. Stat. secs. 5191, 5192</i>), three fifths
      of which the banks not in a reserve city (which see) may keep deposited as
      balances in national banks that are in reserve cities (<i>U. S. Rev. Stat.
      sec. 5192</i>). <i>(c)</i> <i>(Life Insurance)</i> The amount of funds or
      assets necessary for a company to have at any given time to enable it,
      with interest and premiums paid as they shall accure, to meet all claims
      on the insurance then in force as they would mature according to the
      particular mortality table accepted. The reserve is always reckoned as a
      liability, and is calculated on net premiums. It is theoretically the
      difference between the present value of the total insurance and the
      present value of the future premiums on the insurance. The reserve, being
      an amount for which another company could, theoretically, afford to take
      over the insurance, is sometimes called the <b>reinsurance fund</b> or the
      <b>self-insurance fund</b>. For the first year upon any policy the net
      premium is called the <b>initial reserve</b>, and the balance left at the
      end of the year including interest is the <b>terminal reserve</b>. For
      subsequent years the <i>initial reserve</i> is the net premium, if any,
      plus the terminal reserve of the previous year. The portion of the reserve
      to be absorbed from the initial reserve in any year in payment of losses
      is sometimes called the <b>insurance reserve</b>, and the terminal reserve
      is then called the <b>investment reserve</b>.

      Reserve city. <i>(Banking)</i> In the national banking system of the
      United States, any of certain cities in which the national banks are
      required (<i>U. S. Rev. Stat. sec. 5191</i>) to keep a larger reserve (25
      per cent) than the minimum (15 per cent) required of all other banks. The
      banks in certain of the reserve cities (specifically called <i>central
      reserve cities</i>) are required to keep their reserve on hand in cash;
      banks in other reserve cities may keep half of their reserve as deposits
      in these banks (<i>U. S. Rev. Stat. sec. 5195</i>).

      Roman calendar. The calendar of the ancient Romans, from which our modern
      calendars are derived. It is said to have consisted originally of ten
      months, <i>Martius</i>, <i>Aprilis</i>, <i>Maius</i>, <i>Junius</i>, <i>Quintilis</i>,
      <i>Sextilis</i>, September, October, November, and December, having a
      total of 304 days. Numa added two months, <i>Januarius</i> at the
      beginning of the year, and <i>Februarius</i> at the end, making in all 355
      days. He also ordered an intercalary month, <i>Mercedinus</i>, to be
      inserted every second year. Later the order of the months was changed so
      that January should come before February. Through abuse of power by the
      pontiffs to whose care it was committed, this calendar fell into
      confusion. It was replaced by the Julian calendar. In designating the days
      of the month, the Romans reckoned backward from three fixed points, the <i>calends</i>,
      the <i>nones</i>, and the <i>ides</i>. The calends were always the first
      day of the month. The ides fell on the 15th in March, May, July
      (Quintilis), and October, and on the 13th in other months. The nones came
      on the eighth day (the <i>ninth</i>, counting the ides) before the ides.
      Thus, Jan. 13 was called the ides of January, Jan. 12, the day before the
      ides, and Jan. 11, the <i>third</i> day before the ides (since the ides
      count as one), while Jan. 14 was the 19th day before the calends of
      February.

      numerous group, including over 120,000 species. In general, the group is
      characterized by the marked development of the sporophyte, with great
      differentiation of its parts (root, stem, leaves, flowers, etc.); by the

<p>
      Tur"bine (?), <i>n.</i> A form of steam engine analogous in construction
      and action to the water turbine. There are practically only two distinct
      kinds, and they are typified in the de Laval and the Parsons and Curtis
      turbines. The <b>de Laval turbine</b> is an impulse turbine, in which
      steam impinges upon revolving blades from a flared nozzle. The flare of
      the nozzle causes expansion of the steam, and hence changes its pressure
      energy into kinetic energy. An enormous velocity (30,000 revolutions per
      minute in the 5 H. P. size) is requisite for high efficiency, and the
      machine has therefore to be geared down to be of practical use. Some
      recent development of this type include turbines formed of several de
      Laval elements compounded as in the ordinary expansion engine. The <b>Parsons
      turbine</b> is an impulse-and-reaction turbine, usually of the axial type.
      The steam is constrained to pass successively through alternate rows of
      fixed and moving blades, being expanded down to a condenser pressure of
      about 1 lb. per square inch absolute. The <b>Curtis turbine</b> is
      somewhat simpler than the Parsons, and consists of elements each of which
      has at least two rows of moving blades and one row of stationary. The
      bucket velocity is lowered by fractional velocity reduction. Both the
      Parsons and Curtis turbines are suitable for driving dynamos and
      steamships directly. In efficiency, lightness, and bulk for a given power,
      they compare favorably with reciprocating engines.

      any system of telegraphy employing no connecting wire or wires between the
      transmitting and receiving stations. Although more or less successful
      researchers were made on the subject by Joseph Henry, Hertz, Oliver Lodge,
      and others, the first commercially successful system was that of Guglielmo
      Marconi, patented in March, 1897. Marconi employed electric waves of high
      frequency set up by an induction coil in an oscillator, these waves being
      launched into space through a lofty antenna. The receiving apparatus
      consisted of another antenna in circuit with a coherer and small battery
      for operating through a relay the ordinary telegraphic receiver. This
      apparatus contains the essential features of all the systems now in use.

      Wres"tling (?), <i>n.</i> Act of one who wrestles; specif., the sport
      consisting of the hand-to-hand combat between two unarmed contestants who
      seek to throw each other. The various styles of wrestling differ in their
      definition of a fall and in the governing rules. In <b>Greco-Roman
      wrestling</b>, tripping and taking hold of the legs are forbidden, and a
      fall is gained (that is, the bout is won), by the contestant who pins both
      his opponent's shoulders to the ground. In <b>catch-as-catch-can wrestling</b>,
      all holds are permitted except such as may be barred by mutual consent,
      and a fall is defined as in Greco-Roman style. <b>Lancashire style
      wrestling</b> is essentially the same as <i>catch-as-catch- can</i>. In <b>Cumberland
      and Westmorland wrestling</b> the contestants stand chest to chest,
      grasping each other around the body. The one first losing his hold, or
      touching the ground with any part of his body except his feet, loses the
      bout. If both fall to the ground at the same time, it is a <i>dogfall</i>,
      and must be wrestled over. In the <b>Cornwall and Devon wrestling</b>, the
      wrestlers complete in strong loose linen jackets, catching hold of the
      jacket, or anywhere above the waist. Two shoulders and one hip, or two
      hips and one shoulder, must touch the ground to constitute a fall, and if
      a man is thrown otherwise than on his back the contestants get upon their
      feet and the bout recommences.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
